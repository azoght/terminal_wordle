A *curses* program that's like the popular game "Wordle", but in the terminal!

Feel free to play as many times as you like, but be warned, your brain might just hurt after a while!

## Setup

`git clone https://github.com/azoght/terminal_wordle`

Make sure you are in the directory of the module

`python main.py`
